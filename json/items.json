        "description": "Drosophila miranda has a neo-Y chromosome that is ~1 million years old. Because it is heavily degenerate with pseudogenes and repetitive elements, we used multiple state-of-the-art genome assembly technologies to piece it together. This includes Pac-Bio, BAC clone, and BioNano sequencing and scaffolding with chromosome contact data (Hi-C). The resulting neo-Y chromosome is in two contigs, and is three times the size of the ancestral autosome from which it derived.\nMahajan, Shivani, Kevin H-C Wei, Matthew J.
