        "description": "I developed an cost-efficient and simple approach to measure recombination rate at genome scale. This approach called marker selected pools takes advantage of allele frequency decay around a selected locus to infer chromosome-wide recombination rate. The recombination rate and genetic map of a chromosome can be determined in as little as one or two libraries!",
