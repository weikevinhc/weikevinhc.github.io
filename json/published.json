I started my journey with Drosophila in this very department and in the Life Science Institute as a summer NSERC student with Dr. Vanessa Auld, and now I am coming back as an Assistant Professor. Get in touch if you love Drosophila and are interested in genetic conflicts. If you don't like flies, well, you should rethink your life choices...",

	"description": "Transposable elements are selfish genetic elements and are typically suppressed by the host genome. Working with the talented grad student Dat Mai, we are evaluating how often TEs escape host suppression causing rapid increases in copy number. To do this, we assembled genomes of 7 closely related species in the nasuta species group with nanopore sequencing and identified TE insertions across these genomes. Using phylogenetics, we find widespread suppression escapes across the species, revealing the importance of TEs in the context of early speciation and recent divergence.",

	"name": "Heterochromatin nucleation during embryogenesis",
	"description": "During early embryogenesis, the embryo transitions from utilizing maternally deposited RNA to producing its own. This is known as the maternal-zygotic transition, which happens at around cell cycle 13. During this time, the heterochromatin rapidly appears at repeats and pericentric regions to prevent deleterious activity of transposable elements. We are currently using maternal deposited RNAi knock-downs to identify maternal transcripts that play a role in the establishment of heterochromatin at this point.",

	"name": "Epigenetic conflict on the degenerating neo-Y",
	"description": "The Y chromosome is replete with selfish repetitive elements, like transposable elements. If improperly silenced, they can cause deleterious mutations throughout the genome. When a neo-Y chromosome is form, it will gradually accumulate repeats while losing genes, in a process called degeneration. During this process novel TE insertions are in conflict with nearby genes; the epigenetic machinary silencing the former may unadverdantly downregulate the latter. This causes a toxic Y chromosome that is deleterious in males.

	"description": "I explore the analytical relationship between recombination rate, genetic distance and recombinant fraction, and their effects of allele frequnecy decay. Based on the theoretical results, I developed an cost-efficient and simple approach to measure recombination rate at genome scale. This approach called marker selected pools takes advantage of allele frequency decay around a selected locus to infer chromosome-wide recombination rate. The recombination rate and genetic map of a chromosome can be determined in as little as one or two libraries!<br/><br/>Wei KH-C, Mantha A, Bachtrog D.
