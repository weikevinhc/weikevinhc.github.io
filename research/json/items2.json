        "description": "Drosophila miranda has a neo-Y chromosome that is ~1 million years old. Because it is heavily degenerate with pseudogenes and repetitive elements, we used multiple state-of-the-art genome assembly technologies to piece it together. \\nThis includes Pac-Bio, BAC clone, and BioNano sequencing and scaffolding with chromosome contact data (Hi-C). The resulting neo-Y chromosome is in two contigs, and is three times the size of the ancestral autosome from which it derived.",

        "description": "Unlike spermatogenesis, oogenesis is assymetric where despite producing four meiotic products, only one becomes the oocyte, while the rest become supporting cells. This assymetry presents an opportunity for selfish elements to increase their chance of being included in the oocyte, therefore increasing their fitness. Because repetitive elements predominantly reside in or around the centromere, they are prime suspects to be meiotic cheaters by affecting centromere function during chromosome segregation.</br></br>Image from Thinglink",
