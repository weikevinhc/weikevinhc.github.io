        "description": "During early embryogenesis, the embryo transitions from utilizing maternally deposited RNA to producing its own. This is known as the maternal-zygotic transition, which happens at around cell cycle 13. During this time, the heterochromatin rapidly appears at repeats and pericentric regions to prevent deleterious activity of transposable elements. We are currently using maternal deposited RNAi knock-downs to identify maternal transcripts that play a role in the establishment of heterochromatin at this point.",

        "description": "Unlike spermatogenesis, oogenesis is assymetric where despite producing four meiotic products, only one becomes the oocyte, while the rest become supporting cells. This assymetry presents an opportunity for selfish elements to increase their chance of being included in the oocyte, therefore increasing their fitness. Because repetitive elements predominantly reside in or around the centromere, they are prime suspects to be meiotic cheaters by affecting centromere function during chromosome segregation.</br></br>Image from Thinglink",
