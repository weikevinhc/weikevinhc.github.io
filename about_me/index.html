					<p id="firstCategoryText"> I am currently a K99 post-doctoral fellow at UC Berkeley working with Doris Bachtrog and Scott Hawley (Stowers Institute). I am joining the Department of Zoology at UBC in January 2023 as an Assistant Professor. I am interested in the evolution and variability of fundamental molecular and cellular processes, e.g. meiosis, chromatin landscape, recombination, repeat regulation and gene expression. Fruit flies are ripe for such inquiries given the large catalog of well-characterized species and the immense genetic resources. I take an integrative approach, marrying classical and population genetics, molecular biology, and cutting-edge genomic techniques. With the rapid advances of sequencing technology, it's clear that time flies like an arrow, and fruit flies like bananas.<br><br> </p>
					<p id="firstCategoryText">
					Where did you grow up? Born in Taipei, Taiwan then moved to Vancouver, British Columbia.<br><br>
					Undergrad? McGill University. Double-majored in Molecular Biology and Cognitive Science. My undergraduate research was supervised by Ehab Abouheif studying polyphenism in ants.<br><br>
					Ph. D.? Cornell University, co-mentored by Andy Clark and Dan Barbash.<br><br>
					What did you study? My dissertation was on the evolution of repetitive sequences. I explored how they diverge between and within species, and mechanisms that led to their rapid evolution.<br><br>
					What is your K99 grant on? I am exploring the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms underlying the gain and loss of male recombination in the nasuta species group (K99GM137041-01A1).<br><br>
					Why flies? Because they are awesome! But I also dabble in other organisms/systems.<br><br>
					
					Mac or PC? ChromeOS with crouton and crostini, yummmmm. <br><br>
					What do you code in mostly? perl (I am a dinosaur), bash, and R. <br><br>
					
					Cat person with picture of a dog? Some say Shibas are the cats of the dog world... <sup> And <sup> Doraemon <sup> is a <sup>robot cat.</sup></sup></sup></sup> <br><br>
					How many cats do you have? Three, two domestic short hairs, and a Shiba neko.<br><br>
					
					MJ or LeBron for the GOAT? Manu Ginobili.<br>
